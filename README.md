# Exercise - thermal expansion of polymers

Instruction

1. Work in a jupyter notebook.

1. Load the `dataset.csv` file to Python. Use the `df = pd.read_csv` function of the pandas package (`pip install pandas`). The dataset contains multiple polymers with Tg and cte values. See the file description below for more information. 

2. Visualize the polymers using RDKit (`pip install rdkit`). Use the `Draw.MolsToGridImage` function and the `legend` argument to plot the polymers and the SMILES strings. Hint: `Draw.MolsToGridImage(mols, legends=df.smiles.tolist())`

3. Use matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`) to plot `cte_exp` (ordinate) vs `abb` (abscissa) using dots with dashed lines. Hint: `plt.plot(x,y, 'o--)`.

4. The empirical rule by Boyer-Spencer [1] states that `cte_bs * Tg = 0.08`. Add a column `cte_bs` to the data frame that contains the computed `cte_bs` for each polymer. `Tg` is already available in the data frame for each polymer. Plot both `cte_exp` and `cte_bs` vs `abb` in an new plot.

5. Find a new Boyer-Spencer parameter `a` that better fit to our data set. Use scipy's `curve_fit` function (`pip install scipy`) to fit the function `cte = a / Tg`. You should find `a = 0.035` (`cte_bs_own = 0.035 / Tg`). Add `cte_bs_own` to the data frame and plot `cte_exp`, `cte_bs`, and `cte_bs_own` vs `abb` in a new plot to find out how much better your own rule fits the data.
